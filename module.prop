description=This is primarily intended for extending battery lifespan (or service life). On the flip side, it is a general purpose /sys interface manipulation utility (i.e., for setting CPU Governor, scaling frequencies and pretty much anything else). It works with any root solution. Magisk 17.0+ is preferred. Versions below that are not supported. Refer to README.md for details.
